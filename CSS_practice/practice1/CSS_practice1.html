            <p>Being able to design a website is more than writing html and css. Your website has to communicate multiple messages to an audience and your design uses a visual language to communicate.</p>
            <p>Do you speak that visual language?</p>
            <p>A website needs to engage a visitor in conversation within 2 seconds. As a designer it’s your job to begin that conversation. Within milliseconds visitors begin to make judgements about a site that will set the tone for everything else that follows.</p>
            <p>In such a short amount of time the only communication between site and visitor are the visuals of your design. How confident are you with that visual communication? I wasn’t until I learned the principles of design.</p>

            <p>I entered the world of web design as a front end coder. I knew html, css, and a bit of javascript. What I didn’t know was how to communicate visually. I could build a website, but I couldn’t design one.</p>
            <p>Fortunately I was aware of my limitations and spent several years learning all those things you would usually learn earning a degree in graphic design.</p>
            <p>At the time there was very little information about design fundamentals available online. As hard as it might be to believe, there was even less than there is now. I turned to the world of offline books and read, and read, and read.</p>
            <p>Some books taught me a lot and others not so much. They often overlapped each other in the things they talked about so it was a lot of reading.</p>
            <p>My goal with this book is to help you save some of the time I had to spend to get started. I’ve compiled what I’ve learned and organized the information in a way I think makes it easier to understand.</p>

            <p><b>Chapter 3: Attributes</b></p> Structures: Patterns and Textures — What’s the difference between a pattern and a texture and how do they help differentiate elements Size, Scale, Proportion — How do size, scale and proportion help create hierarchy and rhythm – How to develop elements that work together in harmony Color — One of the first things people will notice in your design is color. Make sure the colors you choose are communicating your message Direction and Movement — How do these characteristics of elements lead the eye around a composition Visual Weight and Visual Direction — The sum of all attributes. What is visual weight and why is it so important?
            <p><b>Chapter 4: Principles</b></p> Gestalt — Observations about how we perceive our visual landscape.
