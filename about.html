	<h1>Janice Chen</h1>
    <p>I graduated from NTUB.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1917, National Taipei University of Business (NTUB) is one of the most prestigious universities in Taiwan, dedicated to providing the best business education to students from all over the world.</p>
    <p>NTUB has been an important part of the economic development in Taiwan. NTUB cooperates closely with not only companies in Taiwan but also many institutions abroad.</p> 
    <p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the schoolâ€™s administrative and teaching personnel, as well as the invaluable contribution made by current and former students, the National Taipei College of Business became the National Taipei University of Business in August, 2014.</p>
    <p>Founded for over ninety years, NTUB has boasted a proud and illustrious history and an excellent reputation. With aspirations of being crowned the top business school in the country, NTUB was awarded no less than eight first ratings in the professional field, and one first rating in the Administrative field, during the 2011 installment of the annual Technical & Vocational College Awards Ceremony. </p>
    <p>NTUB students are encouraged to take a diverse range of approaches to studying and to thinking creatively. This has led NTUB students to receiving numerous awards in both national and international vocational competitions.</p>
